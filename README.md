### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Iâ€™m a passionate PhD student in IT. Iâ€™m fond of computer sciences and particularly domains of Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research. I read a lot of books during my free time and sometimes collaborate into the IT free world. My goal is to continue in this vast domain of IT research.
